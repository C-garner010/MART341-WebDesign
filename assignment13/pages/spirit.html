    <h1>Le Spirit</h1>
    <p>This is where a collection of blog posts regarding a person's spirit will go (and all blog posts regarding my own spirit as well.)</p>
    <p>I am beginning to see how everything begins to set up/ structure within each other like links within certain boxes and such, however, I also now see how this can be a job. Definitely takes quite a while with a precision for attention to detail. I do love it. But I am also figuring out that I need to take breaks to keep from getting frustrated as well as keep the creativity flowing (at least a bit more freely).</p>
    <p>Because I am moving to Missoula, I have been looking for new jobs. I have been inspired to look for entry level/ paid internships for web development and design/ communication (because my degree is in communication).Otherwise, I will keep pursuing it for my own site, especially over the summer.</p>

        <p>This photo is The Great Awakening Map. I would like it somewhere deep in my own site, hence the addition of it now.</p>
