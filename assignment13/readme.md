When you open the site to the index.html, I can't seem to open the links to the other pages. But, when I open any of the other html pages, I am able to click between the links smoothly. I don't know why. If I turned my title into my home link, would that fix it? I would like to have it figured out for my final website, so if I can't figure it out in time, I may email my questions a few days before it's due so I can have it figured out. 

I am definitely getting closer/ and smoother at making sites. It has been fun to see each site of mine get what seems is leaps and bounds better. I am excited to see where I will get to by the end of the summer with this site of mine! (And hopefully an entry level job that would help get me further, faster.)

But, I guess I don't think my skills are also good enough yet. But, that's also only as of now. So, I will keep working and see where it gets me! If others can do it, so can I! 

Anyways, I am proud of my work this week. I finally had some extra time which helped me really develop more of the working parts. I have even more time this coming week as my two weeks notice are finally almost fulfilled and so I will be able to spend even more time in trying to really complete the final site for the class this semester. 

I think my biggest struggle was and still is trying to figure out why my index now won't link everything properly, but everything else does. 

I am also proud of the fact that I did get my css to apply to each page. That was awesome. I am excited to really dive in deep with details for my css sheets in the future. Really make every detail how I want it. A job would facilitate that, the jobs I am currently in do not (unfortunately, swimming and serving really don't spare time for web development no matter how hard I try.)

But yet again, here I am. Creating. Nothing will stop me. It would just be nice to finally have a job that would maybe encourage me instead. Or at the bare minimum, let me work on web projects on my own time for others. That would be cool. I'll make something work. Somehow. But for now, I am going to rest in a week's worth of well done work. 

I'll see this code tomorrow, 

Cheers! 

Oh, super quick. I am really proud of getting my site to be relative sizing. That was also really tricky and took some time (along with getting my header to become relative sizing, that seemed even more complicated) but I realized I was indeed messing up my css order as well as repeating some style directions which would contradict my end goal. 

Remembering all of these small details will be a noted challenge for larger sites and additional (hopefully) daily posts, but, I will get smoother at that, much like I have gotten smoother at my typing rate (a qualm I noted in one of my first assignments). Here's to finding challenges exciting and new opportunities enticing. I am so excited to see what the future will help me to create.
