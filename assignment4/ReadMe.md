# Report

I think I am slowly figuring things out; however, this is definitely a challenge. A fun challenge none-the-less. 

This week's most confusing aspect was the intricacies surrounding the different browsers. I have downloaded the relative "main ones", but it will take some tinkering and exploration to find out how best to use the varying ones. 

The other challenge I am still facing is working from an iOS system. I am definitely finding my way around it, but because I am enjoying this so much, it is just another incentive to save for a laptop that can further this pursuit of mine. 

I am trying to pay attention to every little detail so I can replicate it with my own website. I just recently shut down an annon. wordpress blog due to the fact that it costs way too much to pay them to host it/ keep everthing "easy". Being capable and able to design my own website in it's entirety is super exciting. Being able to (hopefully) have total control over the entire site is also super enticing. As I write this report however, I will definitly have to work on my spelling, or type this up somewhere else before submitting, because I fear that I have made a few spelling errors that I am unaware of. 

I would like to know how to specifically replicate these steps towards making my own website so that I can keep working on/ developing outside and after this class. I am trying to do it in tandum, but because this is all so new, it's hard without knowing even an idea of how the final product will turn out. At the end of the day I know it will come with time but I am absolutely ready to begin now. 

I would like to have a very interactive, clean (but also vibrant), complex site/ blog that dives down multiple rabit holes/ facets. One of my inspirations is the highexistence.com website that is just phenomenal. You can dive for hours and still not feel that you've been below even the surface. I know that is many years off, but if I start planning and organizing now like you say, I know that I will be that much closer later. 

I want my site to be a collection of me. A replica of me. I don't really do social media in part because I am a very quiet and observant person. However, if I could spend years developing a site that is a collection of my creations, I know I would be proud of the outcome. Social media doesn't allow for the flexibility and creativity that building a website allows for (obviously). 

I may be using this as a record keeper myself. I am definitely excited to see where I will be at the end of this course, and I am also really excited to see where I will be at the end of a year, two, five, and more. 

I knew about two years ago that this was probably what I want to do, and as I am diving into the beginning of this immense challenge, I feel reaffirmed that this is exactly it. I love the details, I love the organization, I love the ability to work online, I love the control, freedom, creativity, everything. 

Thank you for your time, consideration, assistance, and attention to detail. I am so excited about this class and everything I am learning/ will continue to learn! 

Cheers! Here's to new beginnings.
