<h1>Callan</h1>
<p>This is my first paragraph. It is nothing too exciting, but I sure do hope it works.</p>
<p>Another fun paragraph! This is wildly exciting; being able to learn how to make my own website from scratch.</p>

<hr> 

<p>I am going to add this in because I spent a minute transfering it from markdown into HTML and even though I can't snag a preview, my name came through okay, so I want to see if this comes through as well.</p>

<h1>Report</h1>
<p> I think I am slowly figuring things out!
</p>
This week's most confusing aspect was the intricacies surrounding the different browsers. I have downloaded the relative "main ones", but it will take some tinkering and exploring to find out how best to use the varying ones. As well as figuring out how that translates into the DOM. DOM may be one of the trickiest things I have yet to fully comprehend. I think continuing to practice and see the results will help solidify the understanding of how it all works together. 
</p>
The other challenge I am still facing is working from an iOS system. I am definitely finding my way around it, but because I am enjoying this so much, it is just another incentive to save for a laptop that can further this pursuit of mine. 
</p>
I am trying to pay attention to every detail so I can replicate and test it with my own site. I just recently shut down an annon. wordpress blog due to the fact that it costs way too much to pay them to host it/ keep everthing "made". Being capable and able to design my own website in it's entirety is super exciting. Being able to (hopefully) have total control over the entire site is also super enticing. As I write this report however, I will definitly have to work on my spelling, or type this up somewhere else before submitting, because I fear that I have made a few spelling errors that I am unaware of. 
</p>
I would like to know how to specifically replicate these steps towards making my own website so that I can keep working on/ developing outside and after this class. I am trying to do it in tandum, but because this is all so new, it's hard without knowing even an idea of how the final product will turn out. At the end of the day I know it will come with time but I am so excited to begin now. 
</p>
I would like to have a very interactive, clean (but also vibrant), complex site/ blog that dives down multiple rabit holes/ facets. One of my inspirations is the [highexistence.com](https://www.highexistence.com/) website that is just phenomenal. You can dive for hours and still not feel that you've been below even the surface. I know that is many years off for me, but if I start planning and organizing now like you say, I know that I will be that much closer in the future. 
</p>
I want my site to be a collection of me. A replica of me. I don't really do social media in part because I just don't really enjoy it. However, if I could spend years developing a site that is a collection of my creations, I know I would be proud of the eventual outcome. Social media doesn't allow for the flexibility and creativity that building a website allows for (duh). 
</p>
I may be using this as a record keeper myself. I am definitely excited to see where I will be at the end of this course, and I am also really excited to see where I will be at the end of a year, two, five, and more. 
</p>
I knew about two years ago that this was probably what I want to do, and as I am diving into the beginning of this immense challenge, I feel reaffirmed that this is exactly it. I love the details, I love the organization, I love the ability to work online, I love the control, freedom, creativity, everything. 
</p>
Thank you for your time, consideration, assistance, and attention to detail. I am so excited about this class and everything I am learning/ will continue to learn! 
</p>
Cheers! Thank you again.

<h1>Here are my moodle answers!</h1>
<h2>1. Explain how web browsers function</h2>
<p>When a user puts in a request to view information, the web browser will request/ process information from the website’s source and display it on the viewer’s screen. The information that passes through the web browser includes HTML/ XML/ XHTML/ CSS/ JavaScript files, etc. This information is then processed/ interpreted by the web browser and then displayed in a cohesive site for the viewer. Web browser’s include user interface, Rendering engine (visual representation of the web page), browser engine, network connection, programming language/ javascript interpreter, and data storage.</p>
<h2>2. Define and describe DOM</h2>
<p>DOM is the Document Object Model. In my attempts at fully comprehending what DOM is, I have found it to be a sort of “programming interface” but as someone who is totally new to this sphere of knowledge, I must admit that I don’t entirely comprehend what a “programming interface” is exactly. So, I looked up more definitions which inevitably led me to photos of longer examples and here’s what I can gather: you can manipulate images’ height, width, boarder, and other attributes (I’m assuming), you can style text through size, color, font (?). Then as the examples continued, I sorta understood style sheets, but I would need then an example of how it looks running on the site (I did ask the question, can you apply a style sheet on just one page of the site in comparison to a site “revamp” where you apply a style sheet to the whole site, changing everything?). Other examples of DOM (that I did not understand -yet) were event propagation, getComputedStyle, Displaying Event Object Properties, and Using the DOM Table Interface. I do now know that DOM has the ability to basically <i>style</i> your whole (?) site. I must also admit that I don’t entirely understand the difference between DOM and my source code. If DOM has the ability to help correct my invalid HTML, why wouldn’t I run my entire source code through DOM to begin with?</p>
<h2>3. What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML?</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML - Is the most common and also the original web language, however the usage is more varied which can affect how your site presents across different browsers. It is also used to “render” content and help page design/ setup.</li>
</p>
<li>XML - In comparison to HTML, XML does not “render” your content for you. You must put in the tags and structure yourself to utilize XML. XML also “<i>describes</i> document nodes, whereas HTML *displays* document nodes.”</li>
</p>
<li>XHTML - Is the most “concrete” of the languages. For everything to function properly, XHTML requires more “rigorous [and] precise” work. There seems to be a higher chance that everything is up to the right standard if everything runs smoothly in XHTML.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4. What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need?</h2>
<ol>
<li>Mandatory Structure</li>
</p>
<li>Properly Nested Tags</li>
</p>
<li>Closed Elements</li>
</p>
<li>Lowercase Letters and Attributes</li>
</ol>
<h2>5. What is the index.html page for? Where does it go?</h2>
<p>The index.html page is the site’s homepage. If you look up the site at …com, you could theoretically look it up under …com/index.html and find the same site. Therefore it goes directly in your root folder with it’s own file (it needs to reside at the root level).</p>
<h2>6. Review: What are some of the best naming practices?</h2>
<ul>
<li>set up the proper structure/ organization/ file management</li>
</p>
<li>“index.html”</li>
</p>
<li>“ReadMe.md”</li>
</p>
<li>no spaces or funky characters</li>
</p>
<li>you can use underscores or dashes instead of spaces</li>
</p>
<li>don’t <i>usually</i> start the name of my file with a number</li>
</p>
<li>I will probably try to use all lowercases instead of capitalization or camel casing because I know I will mix those up</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>I see a little more now why you wouldn't want to go back and forth between markdown and HTML. That took a minute and it wasn't even that much. So how/ why do we choose a certain language and when do we know when to use each one? Or do we have to double down on material and run it through both? Or only do that for the super important stuff? I also need to begin diving deeper into images. I run into extra problems here on the iOS system, so it will be interesting to see how I can get it to "run" smoother and if this new program I am practicing on will allow me to preview images unlike the other program I am using as well.</p>
