<h1> Sarah J. Maas and her accompanying series</h1>

<br> 

<p>There is something special about being able to sit down and disappear into your favorite fantasy realm. A realm filled with all of the possibilities that aren’t normally available to a world without magic, in combination with the magic of the real world. In all of the series written by [Sarah J. Maas](https://sarahjmaas.com/about/), readers can find themselves deep within a world of many different types of magic. </p>
<p>In Maas’ first series, <i>The Throne of Glass</i>, the main character is a young woman who is a well-renowned assassin. She captures the notice of the monarch, and the first book starts out with her training to become “the King’s assassin” - a position that gave her greater freedoms than before. But as most books do, the rest of the books begin to unravel the intricacies and complexities surrounding her new position and all it entails. Not only do these books capture the spirit of a young woman quite well, but they also capture the magic hidden within the ability to change yourself based on presented circumstances.</p>
<p>In Maas’ second series, <i>A Court of Thrones and Roses</i>, the main character is also a young woman who is introduced to a “new and better” environment. However, in similar fashion, the rest of the books begin to unravel the truth behind the change. Unlike ToG, ACOTAR’s first book is a bit of a slow burn. At one point, TikTok picked up these books and began talking about how amazing they are. Many were confused after finishing only the first book, sure it was good, but it wasn’t this magical zenith that everyone so seemed to portray it as. Just like any true love however, it takes dedication and patience; but oh how it is worth it. By the middle of the second book, readers can really begin to see just how fabulous Maas’ is at weaving in magic, fantasy, and true love. Healthy love. Suddenly, you have found yourself staying up far too late into the night just to finish “one more chapter.”</p> 
<p>Maas’ third and most recent series, <i>Crescent City</i>, the main character is yet again a young woman (this is always wildly satisfying to read because most fantasy novels are led with male protagonists), however, I believe this series to be her best. You can tell that Maas’ writing style has evolved through all of her previously written works, making this series seem to be her best yet.</p> 
<p>Be warned, the beginning is a slow burn and does require a bit of time on your end trying to memorize and decipher all of the different houses, groups, jobs, and the such. However, as you continue on into the book, you begin to realize that these intricate world building steps were necessary to get the story where she was intending it to be. By the end of <i>Crescent City</i>, you can almost physically feel the emotions that the main character is going through. The final 200 pages are filled with such an explosion of brilliance, it is hard to read without crying. I personally have re-read this ending a few times in hopes of being able to memorize every small detail.</p> 
<p>The world building from the beginning is so important to the final scenes, trust me when I say that it is so unbelievably worth it. She does a similar ~vibe~ in her second book of the series, using the beginning to set every new thing up again, only to explode out of the previously defined confines at the end.</p> 
<p>Maas’ recently released the third book in the <i>Crescent City</i> series that I am currently working on finishing. It seems to be similar to her previous books causing the beginning to be a bit drawn out, but I am very excited to see how she will end this one.</p> 
<p>All of her books are filled with what seems to be honest, genuine, and authentic perspectives and characters. Many don’t see it at first however, if readers follow through with the aforementioned dedication and patience by the end of a single book by Maas, you are left with wanting more. Craving more. Needing more.</p> 
<p>I have recommend all of these books to many people whom I love and respect who are looking for female heroine archetype vibes set in an alternate universe. If you want a series that can captivate you for a few days/ weeks, these would be a great place to begin especially because if you finish one series and like it, you have a high chance of enjoying her other two series.</p>
