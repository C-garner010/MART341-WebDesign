This week seemed to be a bit more confusing for me. My biggest challenge was figuring out how to internally link photos. And then I still have yet to figure out how to link back after clicking on the photo, to then go back to the home page. 

I also do not have access to GitHub desktop due to only working from an iPad for now, but I did take a screen shot of the iOS app that I can download instead. 

My biggest problem still stands as working from an iPad. I just hope that being able to figure out these work-arounds will allow me smoother work in the future when I am able to work from a laptop instead. 

Next week, I am going to continue focusing more on how to imbed those internal links between the site.
