My biggest challenge this week was trying to figure out why my javascript won't work. I don't know why. I have tried a few different variations and it still won't load. 

It'll be interesting to see how that continues to add in and gain in depth, exciting too. 

I found that I struggled with trying to figure out how to link the title to the index home page because right now you have no way back home. This is another goal of mine that I will work on over the summer. 

I have decided to go after the web development certification so I'll take creative coding next semester, and then web technologies the semester after. I am really interested in figuring out how to make all of the small pieces work together. As of now, it's just a matter of time. Time to finish up here in great falls, time to finish these classes, time to get/ start a new job. I know it'll all still come with time, I just get so excited and want to be there now. But, that's where I am reminded that it's about the journey, not the destination. 

How can I speed up my journey, so I can reach this first destination, so I can know what I need to do next. Trust me, I know, I hear it too. It's just, I am so ready. Ready for what? More. All of it. Life. I am ready to begin working, creating, making, and living a creative life. I want it now. Patience, I tell myself yet again. And yet, I go back through to full circle. So at the end of the day, tomorrow, I will get 1% better, again. Day after day. Until the day I feel as good as I know I can. I will get there, in a matter of time. 

Until that day, here's to the 1% each day that will eventually get me there.
