        <h1>The end of the beginning</h1>
        <p>It's weird, coming to the end of things. I have so many more questions and only feel as if I've just begun. I am excited to see where I will go from here and have absolutely no plans of stopping. In fact, I have registered for creative coding next semester so I can pursue a certificate in web development. I am also excited to get to practice all that I have learned over the summer on a practice site of my own. I'm hoping I can make some serious progress before I take web technologies and web servers. I would like to figure out how to make room for class about illustrator and vector graphics, but only time and money will tell. So for now, I definitely have a greater and more fleshed out plan than before so I am excited! 
        </p>
        <p>Over the summer, my plan is to work on adding in more pages with proper links to support a rough attempt at a blog. I will also be able to allow myself a bit more time to write so when I decide to begin publishing, I will have a greater cushion and "backup" pool to pull from. </p>
        <p>This "final" site of mine is actually the exact opposite, this is the beginning of myself being able to see that I can begin genuinely creating some of the things stuck within my mind. I know that I still have a ton to learn but I am grateful for that awareness now. I am grateful to finally have begun somewhere. There is no where to go but up now.</p>

     <p> I don't yet know how I want my final site to look like entirely, but I know I want some of these photos on my account so I am slowly starting to add them in :)</p>

        <p>This is where my javascript circle is supposed to go. Why can't I ever figure it out on the first few hundred tries? The world will never know...but I know that I will get it eventually...someday...hopefully someday sooner rather than later... but also, I get that it is what it is, so instead, I'll just keep trying I guess.</p>

        <p>I began messing around with foundation, bootstrap, and uikit, but because all of them are so large, complex, and depth-ful, it will take me a while to figure out how to include them to use toward my benefit. I will add that to my list of goals over the summer.</p>
        <p>I didn't entirely understand how to integrate them while not messing up my own css. I also didn't understand what part of the bootstrap files to upload, and/or if I needed up upload all of them.</p>
        <p>I did find it really interesting in the way that it helps provide me the framework and layout for my own css and/ or a combination of the two. I know that foundation can be overwhelming for new users and now I see why. However, I know I like that vibe so that's what I will run with until I learn or figure out otherwise.</p>
