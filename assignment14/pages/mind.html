        <h1>Everything concerning the mind</h1>
        <p>This section will be links and previews to blog posts that have to do with the mind. Much along the lines of disabilities and mental health. There will be a few other random posts that can be classified more mind based instead of the other, but those will be defined later.</p>
        <p>I am thinking photo's as headers for the actual posts, and then this page will have a fun layout of previews as well as snipets for mental health stability (much like tips and tricks blah blah blah).</p>
        <p>I like how when you would read a blog post of mine, I would want that page to look a lot like these. But I want my home page and my link pages to be a bit different and a little more "classically elegant" rather than my personal take on it. These are all just small personal details I am beginning to add in for later.</p>

            <p>I know not everyone wants to talk about mental health and disorders, however, I want to talk about it. And I know that I wanted someone else to talk about it when I was younger. So that is what I will be doing. :)</p>
