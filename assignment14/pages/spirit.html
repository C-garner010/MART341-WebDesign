    <h1>Le Spirit</h1>
    <p>This is where a collection of blog posts regarding a person's spirit will go (and all blog posts regarding my own spirit as well.)</p>
    <p>I am beginning to see how everything begins to set up/ structure within each other like links within certain boxes and such, however, I also now see how this can be a job. Definitely takes quite a while with a precision for attention to detail. I do love it. But I am also figuring out that I need to take breaks to keep from getting frustrated as well as keep the creativity flowing (at least a bit more freely).</p>
    <p>Because I am moving to Missoula, I have been looking for new jobs. I have been inspired to look for entry level/ paid internships for web development and design/ communication (because my degree is in communication).Otherwise, I will keep pursuing it for my own site, especially over the summer.</p>

      <p>This photo was found on pinterest while in search of playlist cover photos. After I found it, I have used it for a variety of other, and rather odd, occasions.</p>

      <p>I would like to eventually make some of these photos different shapes and sizes that will correlate with links to other blog pages and articles.</p>
      <p>These will be fun boxes and will look very nice, but it will require a complete site redesign which I will begin working on over the summer. I don't know if I will go with background colors, and instead go with photos for covers contained within specific boxes and sizes. And then just change out the photos as I continue to grow my site. I'm not entirely sure, to be determined, for sure.</p>

        <p>This photo is "The Great Awakening Map". I would like it somewhere deep in my own site, hence the addition of it now.</p>
