    <h1>12:22</h1>
    <hr />

    <p>Where to begin, let me just jump in. I am quite excited to be able to learn how to begin truly developing websites. This has been a goal of mine for the past few years and so to actually begin and see tangible results is super encouraging. I am finding joy in figuring out the "pieces of the puzzle" per say. Well, relatively of course at this point, but, I'm far further than I was a year ago and that is more than I could ask for.</p>
    <p>One of the minor details I have noticed to be comically frustrating is the change in my trying rate. I am a decent typist, I have hit over 200wpm before but definitly cannot yet keep that up here. And my spelling seems to be iffy to say the least and so it will be fun to see how my efficiency and competence evolves in this aspect.</p>
    <p> I am beginning to see just how quickly this all becomes far  more complex and know I cannot yet fully fathom some of those frustrations, however, I am notebly excited for that challenge in specific because I am finding that I really kinda enjoy it. I like creating an entire something.</p> 
    <p>I'm excited to dedicate my time toward refining my skills in this field. Even if this stayed a personal endevor (which I don't honestly see that being the case but that is one of my main driving forces), I am excited and grateful to have an opportunity to house a part of myself almost <i>eternally</i>. Ah, what a terrifying and yet exhilerating thought.</p> 
    <p>I guess I should begin what I originally came on here to do...</p>

    <h3>12:55 we are just rollin' with the angle numbers recently</h3>

    <p>I wanted to test out the block quote and that specific quote has been on my mind recently so I thought I would bring it back around. I wish I had the time to explore it, but I do have work this evening and need to finish my initial ideas.</p>
    <p>I also hope that this organization of code is proper. I think I am getting there, *knock on wood</p>

    <h2>If I had to choose only 3 songs to listen to for the rest of my life, as of now, these would be my choices.</h2>

      <li><cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUgdbqt2ON0"target="_blank">Elgar's Cello Concerto but specifically performed by cellist Jacqueline Du Pre in 1967</a></cite> and accompanied by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I played the cello for nearly 11 years and this song was (and continues to be) my epitome of beauty found within hidden complexity. I would 100% listen to it for the rest of my life and still find hidden gems veiled in the momentary silences.</li>
      </ul>
      <li><cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjCArmA9nl0" target="_blank">Beautiful World [for Imani]</a></cite> by Kermit Ruffins, Irvin Mayfield, and Haley Reinhard</li>
      <ul>
        <li>I don't remember entirely how I happened across this song almost a year ago, but ever since, I listen to it at least a few times a week. It is genuinely one of the most beautiful songs I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. I would be honored to value this song for the rest of my life.</li>
      </ul>
    <p><sub><i>ooh, yikes, this third one may be a bit tricky</i></sub></p>
  <!--how do I make sure that my indents are where I want them? because I would like "sub thoughts" scattered throughout in smaller sizes and lighter font. I think that's what we are doing with CSS probably so I am excited for sure.-->
      <li>Okay, let me do this, I would be grateful to be able to listen to any song by <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@boniver"target="_blank">Bon Iver</a></cite></li> 
      <ul>
        <li>The <em>vocal talent</em> though</li>

    <h1>The anticipation is wild</h1>
      <p>The attention to detail feels like this beauitul puzzle that I create as I solve it. It'll be super cool to continue following the line.</p>
    <p>Here's to hoping this works out at least to some degree!</p>

  <!--Why do you have to put the underscore in the target before blank?->

  <!--Will I be able to create similar text box like features? Fill certain spaces with controlled background and text? And how would I make a new page link be that entire text box, ie click anywhere in this photo and it will lead you to a subdirectory of "hidden" posts - at least from the home screen. They would still be my pages.-->
