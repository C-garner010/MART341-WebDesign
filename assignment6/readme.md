I don't understand why it won't load?! I need a laptop, it has become a priority. I don't even know where to begin looking for the missing piece without being able to see quicker/ easier feedback of my choices. 

I ended up trying to work with ChatGPT and finally figured out something. I added the branch assignment6 and someohow that allowed it to work. I don't know why and I don't know how yet, but I am happy that at least something has loaded now. 

I saw the text book that you linked in the module and was stoked to find that I had actually purchased it for myself almost two years ago now in the hopes of teaching myself how to do it, and I was never "able" to learn how until now with your guidance. I'm excited to dive more into the details this week.
