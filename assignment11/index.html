    <p>Today is hard... waking up to the feeling of my brain on fire in comparison to a body shutting down is never fun. Most days, I stay in bed, but today, I was required to do mundane, capitalism-based, (excuse my language) shit.</p>
    <p>It's frustrating; knowing that I am supposed to (and want to) be doing other things, and being required to do other unnecessary things to fulfill  societal needs is frustrating to say the least. I don't always enjoy that part, especially while working with people who don't even begin to try and understand those disabilities or other perspectives.</p>
    <p>With that being said, I ended up having a panic attack at work today which shut me down for a little over four hours (aka I lost four hours to my day.) So if this ends up being a bit late, that's why. It's no excuse, only an explanation.</p>
    <p>Therefore, I am only going to do inspirational quotes this week because I do not have the mental capacity for much else. </p></span>
