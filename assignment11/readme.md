This week was a lot: mentally, physically, spiritually, and emotionally. With that being said, I still had fun in testing out the new CSS abilities. 

I went to try and create some buttons, but had issues figuring it out/ getting them to work, so I will save that attempt for a few days later when I am feel more clear and calm. 

Otherwise, I found it neat to begin gaining a greater control over design and small lil' aspects of it all. I see the benefits of working entirely from a CSS sheet when it comes to design. I still see the need for the small details in HTML (espcially if it's just one detail) but I also know see that if it is more than one or two details, it would probably still be best to put it in the CSS sheet in general. 

I wanted to again test out the different page ability, but due to my failure last week, I will admit that I was feeling discouraged. On top of the additional stress this week, I wanted to keep it more simple this time and focus mainly on design. 

I am super excited to continue learning more details. I am also gaining excitement at the fact that when summer comes around, I will finally have the extra time to begin developing and designing my site which is super exciting. 

Long story short, even though this week is long, it's nice to do "hw" that doesn't feel like hw. It just feels like a forward progression towards my goals and I really truly am grateful for the opportunity to not terribly embarrass myself as I learn the beginnings of this all. 

With all of that being said, it is almost midnight and I would like to submit what I have. 

Thank you again, 

Cheers
