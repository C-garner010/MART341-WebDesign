This week definitely went a bit smoother than the previous weeks. I am getting far more comfortable with the laptop and am finding it extremely helpful. The fact that I can save my work and then immediately preview it on a desktop browser saves me close to a couple hours alone. 

I am excited to continue learning how to add in all the small details that make a webpage fun. I am curious about how to add artistic/ creative boarders around text boxes and such. Something like an outline of greenery and vines. 

My biggest challenge this week was finding open sourced audio. It would be interesting to learn how to source audio in different ways. As well as adding personal podcast length clips of audio to certain pages. 

I am interested in learning more about hosting/ domain platforms and how one hosts a website that is constantly and (possibly) exponentially growing. Is it possible without dropping significant amounts of money on platforms? If so, what platforms? 

Cheers!
