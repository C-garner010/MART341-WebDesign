I apologize for the fact that I had to submit this late. My week was entirely filled with work and then a workshop over the entire weekend with just barely missed enough time. 

I found that this week, I did, I figured out how to embed those internal pages which is a win for sure. 

This week was a challenging week due to the amount of things I needed to get done, but I was still proud of my final outcome. I am excited to continue to watch the small details define themselves and form a previously unimaginable picture. 

The biggest challenge for me was simply not having enough time, but I did also see that I can get a lot done even working in short intervals and on a time crunch. Maybe, in fact, it inspires a different outcome. 

Next week I am really excited about CSS (well, this week now) so it will be fun to see how that adds to it all as well.
