How do you properly organize your css style sheet? What would be the order for a highly diverse and complex style sheet? What goes first, how to order each section, the order of each individual section, etc. 

How do you control/ order to adjust the line spacing in certain containers?

How do I get my one specific (entire) parent container to align to the right? 

Why won't my menu items align center when I have them supposed to be aligning center? 
    well, why do I have so many issues with the menu/ header/ navigation section in general. It feels especially challenging

I don't get why my menu dropdown button won't match the same code as the rest of the menu buttons even when I thought I have everything matched up. Is it an order problem? Did I organize it improperly? I don't knowwww. 
    NEVERMIND I THINK I HAVE IT
        now I don't know why I can't change the dropdown button's color. 
        I have everything that I thought was supposed to be white, and it's still not. Grr. I don't have enough time to work on that now because I have spent a decent amount of time trying to figure out the drop down button in general. But I am glad I have the button matching styles now. I had to change it in my index.html and add "menu-item" to the dividerclass for the subgroups. That makes sense. What doesn't is still how, when hovered over, the dropdown links don't pop up as white and pop up as blue. Maybe that's where the answer lies? I'll check it out later, I need to turn in my basic outline for today. 
            NEVERMIND i figured it out. SEE that's why if I write out my frustrations I somehow end up figuring them out. so I guess I will keep doing that.

I would also like to eventually add in actual pages, but low and behold, I don't have the time. 

I am still super excited because as I build the bones right now, I will be able to apply the scaffolding to my site in the summer. I even ordered and just got the same author/ publication for the textbook regarding javascript and jquery and I am excited to begin trying to apply it over the summer once I have a bit more time back. 

It's crazy, how much time has just gone by each day. Between working nearly full time between two jobs, going to school full time, moving, trying to find/ apply for new "inspiring" jobs, writing personal goodbye letters, packings, etc. the time is just flying by. 

But hey, that's when they say life happens so we keep rocketing forward. 

I do also have to say that I am excited for the summer however. Not because the old adage "yay, there's no school" but because I will have the time to really explore the online space and how I want to present myself in the future. Cool shit for sure. 

Anyways, I am wasting a bit of time and need to finish up. I don't know what else to add on my index page for this week, I want to eventually have my home page be a carousel of photos (hence the javascript), some previews of other posts, a box of links to my most popular posts, more buttons that will lead to pages about books, shows, movies, songs, and more. Along with links to my archive of posts and more menu options in my footer. 

The dream, the pre-plan, the design is there. However, it is just this current moment in time that has me in pause. I have other mundane tasks that are "required" of me that take up far too much of my current time. 

Again - I say this more to reiterate it to myself than anything else- I really do believe this is the vibe I want to continue into adulthood. I take weary in calling it a job, because I see myself continuing to do this for fun. It doesn't (yet?) feel like a job, and I think that's a sign. 

I really do enjoy every aspect. It all feels like a huge puzzle and I am excited for all the pieces to begin to come to light. That way I can also begin to put together some pretty cool puzzles. 

I find that may be my biggest struggle, working through these structural pieces. But, that's also the problem for many folks so I remind myself to not feel so bad. The fun part will come later. 

As you can tell, I really began to use this readme as a notes section. It's just a collection of thoughts throughout my process. I like the documentation, it helps me work through my current struggles (and also see how far I've come). 

Now, I don't know how to align my box1 completely to the left. I know it's in the parent container, so would that change be in the index? Well, now, maybe. 
    well now I don't have the time for this one, this one seems really complicated (and I know it probably isn't) but it is still due and I need to work on time management (she says as she procrastinates here instead) I do apologize, hard deadlines make me nervous. 

    I thought by maybe adding in the position it would change the outcome, still not. 


I have to leave my wifi right now so I will turn in what I have, and if I have time later, I will continue to add changes. Thank you for your time and assistance

Cheers, 

thank you again.
