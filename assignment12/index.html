        <h3>Scroll to explore the mind of a "chaos goblin"</h3>
        <p>Type some text</p>
        <p>Type a lot more text</p>
        <p>Continue typing text after text that will eventually string together to create something like a paragraph. From there, these thoughts, these words, will be strung together to create an entire entity. The final relative size has yet to be determined, but isn't that with everything in life? Hindsight is always far different from the igniting ember. Much like person-hood, these words, these thoughts, will grow into themselves. Some will change, a lot, moderately, and maybe only a little. But all in all, the essence is the same. The vibe. Well, until it isn't. But can't you see the success in it all?! The fact that we are at this point now, when we were at a blank beginning only moments before. Wow, how far we have come. Let me say again, only time will tell how the final project will be, but for now, look at us go! Let's stop there, for now...</p>
        <p>Whelp, it seems that I need to write some more text before this slider will work, and/ or I need to change the sizing from percentage to points, maybe that will then work.</p>
        <p>I know that I could find filler text to work with, but I have running commentary constantly in the background of my mind so I might as well make use of it. It's nothing special 98% of the time, but that two percent, some would say is "decent" and I gotta say, I am proud of that.</p>
        <p>And, I also find joy in just being able to right random bullshit whenever I need to.</p>
        <p>One time in middle school, a classmate got a phone call that her grandmother had passed during the birthday sleep over we were all attending. She didn't want to leave, and I wouldn't blame her, I wouldn't want to leave a party either only to go sit in sadness and grief.</p>
        <p>But, by the end of the night, she was sitting alone staring at the stars. I didn't know anything else to do, other than to go sit with her and keep her company and so that's what I did.</p>
        <p>I asked her if she was okay and/ or if she wanted to talk about it and she said no to both (which is totally okay.)So then I asked her if she wanted to sit in silence or have me talk about random things and she ended up choosing the later. As I have grown older, it makes more sense. As I have now experienced my own fair share of trauma, it makes sense. Sitting in silence, listening to your thoughts on repeat, sucks.</p>
        <p>So what have I gotten 'decent' at? Removing the obsessive repetition and turning it into now just a stream of consciousness that only so happens to continue flowing. Nonstop. It's wild. It used to freak me out. But, I've gotten used to it now and am learning how to turn it into my "superpower."</p>
        <p>At the end of the day, it all is what it is. But I do still think about that night in middle school a fair amount. If my random nonsense can bring a grieving person even just the slightest bit of solace, shouldn't I do everything in my power to make that happen?</p>
        <p>I guess that's where I am at in this point of my life; figuring out how to help as many people as I possibly can, while also still staying authentic to myself.</p>
        <p>A journey and a half, let me tell ya'.</p>
