This week was really fun for me. I definitely have a few blunders that I still can't quite figure out after working on them for a while. But I know I will figure them out soon, so I hope this works in the mean time. 

This week, my main (and still current) struggle was figuring out how to apply my CSS to both my about and contact page, as well as figuring out why my contact page won't load in general. At one point I even copy and pasted my code from my index and pasted it into my contact, and then changed the details, and it still doesn't work for some reason and I can't figure out why. 

I found it really interesting and exciting to learn that a web developer's main job is to work on web design, specifically CSS. I had a ton of fun working through the colors and layout, and am excited to learn how to do more complex layouts like the separate boxes, rainbows and other art, etc. 

I began to wonder about how one would begin to link together multiple blog posts under a certain page? Like, how can each page lead to a collection of other pages/ blog posts that through their links would lead to the individual blog post/ pages? 

Anyways, I am at work finishing this up. I was able to get most of it done yesterday and this morning, but am unfortunately stuck here at this point because I also live 30 minutes out of town and do not have time to make it home in time, fix everything, and still submit. 

So I will submit this, and if I have time to go back and fix it when I get home, will do that, it will just unfortunately be past the deadline. 

I again thank you for your time, and am excited to see what I will continue to learn! 

Cheers!
