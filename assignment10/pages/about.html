    <h2>All will be revealed with time...</h2>
    <p>Is she anyone? Is she everyone? Trust me, these are questions she asks herself. This world is so big and beautiful and bright. There is so much to learn, and even knowing just a bit of all that I don't know, is...wow.</p>
    <p>I do enjoy the idea of constantly learning. Transforming.</p>
    <p>Change was scary. And to some degree it still is. But the pain of staying the same is beginning to outweigh the pain of change, therefore, I am here. Yet again, speaking with the ether.</p>
    <p>Well, so be it. Who is she? She's a being of smoke, shadow, and bone. A being of time and a timeless being. She is no one important, but also someone worth knowing. Who is she? Well, time will tell.</p>
    <p>Cheers.</p>
