    <h2>An undetermined title that doesn't really say much at all</h2>
    <p>These past few weeks have been a whirlwind, so I am just going to write for a minute because I haven't done that in a hot second, and lord knows I need to get some of this off my chest.</p>
    <p>There are so many things to do, to say, to get ready for, to unpack from. I adore the fact that I am finally in a place in life where I can relatively manage all that I have to do, and yet, I am so unsure if everything and all that I am doing is the `right` thing or the thing I am `supposed` to be doing.</p>
    <p>I know there is no thing that I am `supposed` to be doing, there are just so many things I do want to do, that when I am not doing those things, I feel as if I am not getting anywhere closer to my goals. I know that's where I need to work to remind myself that everything before me is a part of my journey and is supposed to be there, but it's frustrating for sure.</p>
    <p>Luckily, this class, is one of the things I am ticking off both "in the real world" and for personal/ professional goals. I do truly works towards being able to work solely and entirely online if I wish. Granted, I think having an office to go into if I would like would be nice, however, I truly only dream of being able to work from home.</p>
    <p>Also, the more I find out about this class, such as how CSS/ design is a large part of a web-developer's job, that was exciting to learn.</p>
    <p>I could see myself doing this as a career.</p>
    <p>But, would you like to know a much deeper part of my soul (the music I am listening too inebriates me towards transparency as much as liquid spirits do)</p>
    <p>I cannot see my mind doing anything other than what it wants. There is this passion, urge, desire, to create more than I know what to do with. And yet, that may also be one of the most terrifying parts. Allowing myself succumb to the depths of creation.</p>
    <p>I know that no one will see even a tenth of my total collection, however, isn't that also terrifying?</p>
    <p>I don't know which is worse.</p>
    <p>A question I didn't know struck such fear in my heart until now...</p>
    <p>Bah, it's a bit too late for my silly rambles to take that turn, so let me pivot. I'm sure my mind will find it's way back if it so wishes.</p>
</div>
<div class="secondary-container">
   <p>My singing is slowly getting better, I think about putting it on my future blog (someday) or maybe even putting it on a private page just so I can have my own personal "official&amp;private" collection.</p>
   <p>But that is also, equally almost terrifying. So instead, I'll begin braving singing in stairwells and see where that takes me.</p>
   <p>Maybe if I had more time, this would be where I would put youtube links to some of the official versions of the songs I am working on. Maybe if I have time later, I will do that quickly. Just like the top three or something. It's also just that there are so many, it would be hard to choose.</p>
   <p>Therefore, let me move on, as I am just quickly rambling and spilling thoughts to get words on the page. I am moving to Missoula to move in with my sister in the middle of May. I am quite excited, it just means there is that much more to do. Somehow, my time has begun to shrink again. There are so many hours in a day, and trust me when I say, being narcoleptic does not help. Granted, I don't sleep an average of 14 hours a day, but an average of 10 still isn't the greatest. I am getting there, I do acknowledge that it is also very difficult however.</p>
   <p>But we are getting there! Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast.</p>
   <p>I am also beginning to gain true trust and confidence in what I am beginning to create, so that helps. We are just back to the original question.</p>
   <p>I know I get very caught up in the "mind." I know I can get stuck there, quite literally. </p>
   <p>Let me through this question into the mix. Many people, my father included, are strong proponents and advocates for meditation. Trust me when I say I see the perspective, I hear the wisdom, and feel the value behind it, but my question begins as someone who finds life through her stream of consciousness. As someone who sits at the bottom of the river of thought and looks above at all the words. I am within them, I don't want to quiet that. I want to feel all of it. If that makes sense, I don't know if it does. I think I lost it at the end.</p>
   <p>I know meditation talks about acknowledging any and all thoughts and then letting them pass. Which in a way, the river analogy still stands. However, I am under the belief that meditation's final goal is "total enlightenment" and I believe I understand that as much as a young white woman could understand that in it's entirety. Here again is where my question stands, I don't think I seek enlightenment, I think I seek transcendence. The river is constantly changing, constantly transcending it's previous state. I find enlightenment so pure, it's nearly in-achievable by humans (maybe and theoretically of course). Transcendence isn't in-achievable. Theoretically and maybe of course.</p>
   <p>I don't know where I am going with that entirely, again, this is just a stream of consciousness that has just taken this idea into it's folds.</p>
   <p>Otherwise, I can't sleep, so let me continue.</p>

    <h2>Why am I "here?""</h2>
    <p>So, I am about to get "really personal", however, I have already told this story so many times in so many different variations at this point, I am currently only practicing for my future online writing hopes and so I apologize for subjecting you to my "onslaught of truth" as I so used to call these.</p>
    <p>I am diagnosed as AuDHD which is a new coined term for the combined diagnosis of Autistic and ADHD. The two traits combined are (excuse my language) a sonofab!tch in learning how to live/work/cope/survive/function/every other imaginable aspect of the human experience imaginable. However, I am here today, because I think I am learning genuine coping/ life skills that could be of help to other AuDHD individuals, Queer Individuals, Narcoleptic Individuals, and other's who are just looking for a safe space. I also really need to get my story out in some shape or form for some currently unknown reason. I have been following this thread for the past four years, and it has taken me from nearly mute and completely shut down to now really striving towards my best self again. I know that I'm not quite there yet, but I also know that I will not stop until I get there.</p>
    <p>I have so much I want to do. I have so much I need to do. I can't seem to stop until I do.</p>
    <p>But I think that's why we are finally so close, I feel as if I am beginning my intial sprint towards the cliff. Those last final few hundred yards, each fiber of my being screaming in protest at the trajectory we are headed towards, and yet, we push. I am so close, I feel it so deep within my being, I don't know with what yet, but I know, something. I pray, for something. I need, something.</p>
    <p>That is indeed what life has taught me so far, if I want it, it's up to me to go for it. There is no one who can get me to where I even need to be. I'll do it for myself this time too. I am sprinting with my entire being towards the edge of the cliff. I don't know why, but there's going to be a leap into the unknown really soon, and I am ready. Oh, so, ready</p>
    <p>Cheers.</p>
