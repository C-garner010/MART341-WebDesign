I finally got a laptop so that's exciting!! I got it on super sale so that is a bonus fact!! It has been wild because it took me almost six hours to run the 175 lines of code for the last site and now with this, it took me two hours to get all of that outlined structured properly. I am excited to add in my personal details now that I know how to do those forms and submissions. I was curious about where I would end up sending those answers? I would probably set up an entirely different email to receive them? 

Otherwise I think I need to spend a bit more time working on the buttons now. Because those did give me a bit of a struggle and ended up giving up on those for this week. 

I am excited to continue to add in the more detailed aspects of what makes a website spectacular. I am also excited about the opportunity and power with this laptop. To finally be in a slightly better position to continue finding success in this passionate pursuit of mine is extremely exciting. 

I don't have any pressing concerns this week. It's just continuing to figure out all the small things, but I am also excited by that, so cheers!

My biggest challenge this week was my table. I do admit that I used a free answer on chatgpt to help me just align everything. Once I got the outline I was able to work on tweaking it for a bit to get it where I wanted. I ADORE visual studio code, the ability to save it and then look at a preview in a web browser is phenomenal. That fact alone has been what has saved me so much time. I don't have to go through multiple applications which is so awesome. 

I think at the end of the day, I can't express my gratitude at this opportunity to learn this specific course. Thank you again and I am excited for this coming week!!
